# 🧠 Deep Learning Models for Time-Series Forecasting & NLP

This project implements and experiments with deep learning architectures—specifically LSTM and Transformer models—applied to two core domains:

- ⏱️ **Time-Series Forecasting** (e.g., financial or sensor data)
- 💬 **Natural Language Applications** (e.g., text classification or generation)

The repository includes clean modular code, configurable training pipelines, visualizations, and comprehensive test coverage.

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Predicting multivariate time-series (e.g., stock prices, weather data)
- Generating or classifying text using transformer-based language models
- Fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models for domain-specific tasks
